# CUDA C++ convolution.

This repository contains a CUDA C++ application that applies a kernel filter. I used a default set of values to represent the convolution kernel (simulating only one CNN layer).

## Compile the application

```
sudo apt install libpng++-dev
make
```

# Usage: 

```
./kernel_convolution filter_type image_path cuda_mem_tye
```
